ICS4U Unit on Algorithms

November 26th 2018: 
  Familiarized myself with different algorithms for the 2x2 using https://www.youcandothecube.com/solve-it/2-x-2-solution depending on the positions of the components. From doing so, I have learnt that algoritms are processes or sets of rules that solve (in this case) the cube. These steps I followed were algorithms as they were a process that lead to solving the cube. Therefore, to me an algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a set problem.

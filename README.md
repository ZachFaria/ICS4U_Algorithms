  Familiarized myself with different algorithms for the 2x2 using https://www.youcandothecube.com/solve-it/2-x-2-solution depending on the positions of the components. From doing so, I have learnt that algorithms are processes or sets of rules that solve (in this case) the cube. These steps I followed were algorithms as they were a process that lead to solving the cube. Therefore, to me an algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a set problem.

  Continued praticing with the 2x2 cube and finished memorizing the algorithms on https://www.youcandothecube.com/solve-it/2-x-2-solution to solve the cube on my own. In memorizing these algorithms, I have learnt that the cube has an infinite amount of algorithms to accomplish many different "goals" such as to complete only a single side of the cube (which can be accomplished by different algorithms to achieve the same result). There are an infinite amount of algorithms since no matter how inefficient as long as the cube is solved (appears as desired), then the steps followed to accomplish that is an algorithm. After today, I continue to stand by my previous definition of algorithms being a set of steps to accomplish a set problem.

  Continued to practice known algorithm to increase speed to solve the 2x2 and recorded my times. When doing so in an official like setting I got very nervous and my speed to solve the cube decreased by up to a minute from my average time when not in such a setting. Through this experience I have learnt how much more difficult using algorithms become under pressure and while trying to do them fast (at least of human beings such as myself). Even though under the pressure I made a multitude of mistakes, which contributed to the decreased speed of my attempts, but even so they were still algorithms, as they still acomplished the set goal. I still stand by my previous definition that an algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a set problem.
